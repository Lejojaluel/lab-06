IMPORTANT:


UNM Learn does not allow attaching shell scripts (.sh) files. 
I have attached testbinary.in, which you will copy to your working directory.
Once testbinary.in is in your working directory, run on the command line:

mv testbinary.in testbinary.sh

That will rename testbinary.in too testbinary.sh
